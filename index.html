        adventure is like no other one, was the<br> enchanting landscapes
        and vibrant beauty of kumrat. it is located in the north areas upper dir and it's road are very dangerious. Kumrat is a paradise for <br>nature lovers and a haven for those seeking a deep dive into the traditions of the region.</p>
